# Feature-rank-feature-selection
A noval feature selection method similar to pagerank method, and ultilized Bayesian optimization to search appropriate parameters
# Information of code  
Inspired by PageRank algorithm, we believe that：   
(1)If a feature is related to many other features, it means that the feature Rank value is relatively high.   
(2)If a feature with a high feature Rank value is linked to another feature, the feature Rank value of the linked feature will be increased accordingly.   
The code is in Matlab. A number of functions depend on files in the：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1p96ny8ouuZdAyaReEOf6XA Extraction code:[71xv] Ensure that this folder is added to your Matlab path.
